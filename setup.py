DESCRIPTION = 'Data Analysis and Visualization using Bootstrap-Coupled Estimation.'
LONG_DESCRIPTION = """\
Estimation statistics is a simple framework <https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/>
that—while avoiding the pitfalls of significance testing—uses familiar statistical
concepts: means, mean differences, and error bars. More importantly, it focuses on
the effect size of one's experiment/intervention, as opposed to
significance testing.

An estimation plot has two key features. Firstly, it presents all
datapoints as a swarmplot, which orders each point to display the
underlying distribution. Secondly, an estimation plot presents the
effect size as a bootstrap 95% confidence interval on a separate but
aligned axes.
