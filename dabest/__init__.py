**dabest** is a Python package for Data Analysis and Visualization using Bootstrap-Coupled Estimation.

Estimation statistics is a simple framework <https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/> that—while avoiding the pitfalls of significance testing—uses familiar statistical concepts: means, mean differences, and error bars. More importantly, it focuses on the effect size of one's experiment/intervention, as opposed to significance testing.

An estimation plot has two key features. Firstly, it presents all datapoints as a swarmplot, which orders each point to display the underlying distribution. Secondly, an estimation plot presents the effect size as a bootstrap 95% confidence interval on a separate but aligned axes.

**dabest** creates estimation plots for mean differences, median differences, standardized effect sizes (Cohen's _d_ and Hedges' _g_), and ordinal effect sizes (Cliff's delta).
