Tutorial: Repeated Measures
===========================

DABEST version 2023.02.14 expands the repertoire of plots for experiments with repeated-measures designs. DABEST now allows for the calculation and plotting of effect sizes for:

- Comparing each group to a shared control (control vs. group i; ``baseline``)
- Comparing each measurement to the one directly preceding it (group i vs group i+1; ``sequential``) 

This is an improved version of paired data plotting in previous versions, which only supported computations involving one test group and one control group.

To use these features, you can simply declare the argument ``paired = "sequential"`` or ``paired = "baseline"`` correspondingly while running ``dabest.load()``. As in the previous version, you must also pass a column in the dataset that indicates the identity of each observation, using the ``id_col`` keyword. 

**(Please note that** ``paired = True`` **and** ``paired = False`` **are no longer valid in v2023.02.14)**

    Good evening!
    The current time is Mon Aug 30 00:09:54 2021.

    Paired effect size(s) for the sequential design of repeated-measures experiment 
    with 95% confidence intervals will be computed for:
    1. Test 1 minus Control 1

    5000 resamples will be used to generate the effect size bootstraps.

    Good evening!
    The current time is Mon Aug 30 00:13:17 2021.

    Paired effect size(s) for repeated measures against baseline 
    with 95% confidence intervals will be computed for:
    1. Test 1 minus Control 1

    5000 resamples will be used to generate the effect size bootstraps.



When only 2 paired data groups are involved, assigning either ``baseline``
or ``sequential`` to ``paired`` will give you the same numerical results.

    Good evening!
    The current time is Mon Aug 30 00:14:44 2021.

    The paired mean difference for the sequential design of repeated-measures experiment 
    between Control 1 and Test 1 is 0.48 [95%CI 0.237, 0.73].
    The p-value of the two-sided permutation t-test is 0.001, calculated for legacy purposes only. 

    5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
    Any p-value reported is the probability of observing theeffect size (or greater),
    assuming the null hypothesis ofzero difference is true.
    For each p-value, 5000 reshuffles of the control and test labels were performed.

    To get the results of all valid statistical tests, use `.mean_diff.statistical_tests`

For paired data, we use
`slopegraphs <https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003nk>`__
(another innovation from Edward Tufte) to connect paired observations.
Both Gardner-Altman and Cumming plots support this.

You can also create repeated-measures plots with multiple test groups. In
this case, declaring ``paired`` to be ``sequential`` or ``baseline`` will
generate the same slopegraph, reflecting the repeated-measures experimental design, but different contrast plots, to show the ``sequential`` or ``baseline`` comparison:

.. code-block:: python3
  :linenos:

    sequential_repeated_measures = dabest.load(df, idx=("Control 1", "Test 1", "Test 2", "Test 3"),
                                               paired="sequential", id_col="ID")
