## Recent Version Update

**‚ú® DABEST ‚ÄúBingka‚Äù v2025.10.20 for Python is now released! ‚ú®**

Dear DABEST users, The latest version of the DABEST Python library
brings new visualizations, refined plots, and improved accuracy.

1.  **Whorlmap üåÄ: Compact visualization for multi-dimensional effects**

    Introducing **Whorlmap**, a new way to visualize effect sizes from
    multiple comparisons in a compact, grid-based format.

    Whorlmaps condense information from the full bootstrap distributions
    of many contrast objects into a **2D heatmap-style grid of ‚Äúwhorled‚Äù
    cells**. This provides an overview of the entire dataset while
    preserving the underlying distributional detail.

    They are especially useful for large-scale or multi-condition
    experiments, serving as a **space-efficient alternative to stacked
    forest plots**.

    You can generate a Whorlmap directly from multi-dimensional DABEST
    objects using the `.whorlmap()` method. See the [Whorlmap
    tutorial](https://acclab.github.io/DABEST-python/tutorials/10-whorlmap.html)
    for more details.

2.  **Slopegraphs üìà: Enhanced summaries for paired data**

    Slopegraphs for paired continuous data now display **group summary
    statistics**.

    - By default, a thick trend line connects group means, with vertical
      bars showing standard deviation.

    - Choose the summary type via the group_summaries argument in
      `.plot()` ‚Äî options include `'mean_sd'`, `'median_quartiles'`, or
      `None`.

    - Customize appearance with `group_summaries_kwargs`.

    See the Group Summaries section in the [Plot Aesthetics
    tutorial](https://acclab.github.io/DABEST-python/tutorials/08-plot_aesthetics.html)
    for more details.

3.  **Mini-meta Weighted Delta Fix üßÆ**

    The weighted delta calculation in mini-meta plots has been updated
    for **greater accuracy and consistency**.

4.  **Expanded custom_palette functionality üé®**

    - **Barplots (unpaired, proportional):** `custom_palette` can now
      take `1` and `0` as dictionary keys to color the filled and
      unfilled portions of the plot.

    - **Slopegraphs (paired, non-proportional):** `custom_palette` can
      now color contrast bars and effect-size curves.

See the Custom Palette section in the [Plot Aesthetics
tutorial](https://acclab.github.io/DABEST-python/tutorials/08-plot_aesthetics.html)
for examples.

Thank you for your continued support!

## About

DABEST is a package for **D**ata **A**nalysis using
**B**ootstrap-Coupled **EST**imation.

[Estimation
statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_statistics) are a
[simple framework](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/) that avoids the
[pitfalls](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3288) of significance
testing. It employs familiar statistical concepts such as means, mean
differences, and error bars. More importantly, it focuses on the effect
size of one‚Äôs experiment or intervention, rather than succumbing to a
false dichotomy engendered by *P* values.

An estimation plot comprises two key features.

1.  It presents all data points as a swarm plot, ordering each point to
    display the underlying distribution.

2.  It illustrates the effect size as a **bootstrap 95% confidence
    interval** on a **separate but aligned axis**.

![The five kinds of estimation
plots](showpiece.png "The five kinds of estimation plots.")

DABEST powers [estimationstats.com](https://www.estimationstats.com/),
allowing everyone access to high-quality estimation plots.

## Installation

This package is tested on Python 3.11 and onwards. It is highly
recommended to download the [Anaconda
distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) of Python in order to
obtain the dependencies easily.

You can install this package via `pip`.

To install, at the command line run

``` shell
pip install dabest
```

You can also
[clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository) this repo
locally.

Then, navigate to the cloned repo in the command line and run

``` shell
pip install .
```

## Usage

``` python3
import pandas as pd
import dabest

# Load the iris dataset. This step requires internet access.
iris = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/raw/master/iris.csv")

# Load the above data into `dabest`.
iris_dabest = dabest.load(data=iris, x="species", y="petal_width",
                          idx=("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"))

# Produce a Cumming estimation plot.
iris_dabest.mean_diff.plot();
```

## Testing

To test DABEST, you need to install
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest) and
[nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/).

- Run `pytest` in the root directory of the source distribution. This
  runs the test suite in the folder `dabest/tests/mpl_image_tests`.
- Run `nbdev_test` in the root directory of the source distribution.
  This runs the value assertion tests in the folder `dabest/tests`

The test suite ensures that the bootstrapping functions and the plotting
functions perform as expected.

For detailed information, please refer to the [test
folder](../nbs/tests/README.md)

## DABEST in other languages

DABEST is also available in R
([dabestr](https://github.com/ACCLAB/dabestr)) and Matlab
([DABEST-Matlab](https://github.com/ACCLAB/DABEST-Matlab)).
