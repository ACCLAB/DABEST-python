## Recent Version Update

Dear Dabest users âœ¨**DABEST Bingka v2025.10.20** for Python is now
released! âœ¨

This new version of the DABEST Python library includes new features,
updated graphics, and improved calculations.

1.  **Whorlmap ðŸŒ€**: Introducing a new way to visualize effect sizes
    from multiple comparisons in a grid of whorled square cells. This
    design condenses information from full bootstrap distributions of an
    array of contrast objects into a compact visual representation. It
    optimizes visual real estate by presenting a clear impression of the
    whole dataset at a glance while retaining nuanced distributional
    information for further scrutiny. Whorlmaps are a space-efficient
    alternative to stacked forest plots when working with
    multi-dimensional DABEST objects from large scale experiments.

2.  **Slopegraphs have a new look ðŸ“ˆ**: Slopegraphs for paired
    continuous data now show summary statistics for each group. By
    default, a thick trend line connects group means, with vertical bars
    indicating standard deviation. Users can choose the summary type via
    the `group_summaries` argument in .plot() â€” options include
    `'mean_sd'`, `'median_quartiles'`, or `None`. Appearance can be
    customized using `group_summaries_kwargs`. See the group summaries
    section in the Plot Aesthetics tutorial for more details.

3.  **Fixed Mini-meta Weighted Delta Calculation ðŸ§®**: The weighted
    delta in mini-meta plots has been updated to ensure accurate
    calculation and reporting of the weighted delta.

4.  **Expanded custom_palette functionality ðŸŽ¨**:

    - **Barplots (unpaired, proportional)**: The custom_palette dict can
      now take 0 and 1 as keys to color the filled and unfilled portions
      of the plots. See the custom palette section in the Plot
      Aesthetics tutorial for more details.

    - **Slopegraphs (paired, non proportional)**: The custom_palette can
      now be used to color the contrast bars and effect-size curves. See
      the custom palette section in the Plot Aesthetics tutorial for
      more details.

## About

DABEST is a package for **D**ata **A**nalysis using
**B**ootstrap-Coupled **EST**imation.

[Estimation
statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_statistics) are a
[simple framework](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/) that avoids the
[pitfalls](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3288) of significance
testing. It employs familiar statistical concepts such as means, mean
differences, and error bars. More importantly, it focuses on the effect
size of oneâ€™s experiment or intervention, rather than succumbing to a
false dichotomy engendered by *P* values.

An estimation plot comprises two key features.

1.  It presents all data points as a swarm plot, ordering each point to
    display the underlying distribution.

2.  It illustrates the effect size as a **bootstrap 95% confidence
    interval** on a **separate but aligned axis**.

plots](showpiece.png "The five kinds of estimation plots.")

DABEST powers [estimationstats.com](https://www.estimationstats.com/),
allowing everyone access to high-quality estimation plots.

## Installation

This package is tested on Python 3.11 and onwards. It is highly
recommended to download the [Anaconda
distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) of Python in order to
obtain the dependencies easily.

You can install this package via `pip`.

To install, at the command line run

``` shell
pip install dabest
```

You can also
[clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository) this repo
locally.

Then, navigate to the cloned repo in the command line and run

``` shell
pip install .
```

## Usage

``` python3
import pandas as pd
import dabest

# Load the iris dataset. This step requires internet access.
iris = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/raw/master/iris.csv")

# Load the above data into `dabest`.
iris_dabest = dabest.load(data=iris, x="species", y="petal_width",
                          idx=("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"))

# Produce a Cumming estimation plot.
iris_dabest.mean_diff.plot();
```

## Testing

To test DABEST, you need to install
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest) and
[nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/).

- Run `pytest` in the root directory of the source distribution. This
  runs the test suite in the folder `dabest/tests/mpl_image_tests`.
- Run `nbdev_test` in the root directory of the source distribution.
  This runs the value assertion tests in the folder `dabest/tests`

The test suite ensures that the bootstrapping functions and the plotting
functions perform as expected.

For detailed information, please refer to the [test
folder](../nbs/tests/README.md)

## DABEST in other languages

DABEST is also available in R
([dabestr](https://github.com/ACCLAB/dabestr)) and Matlab
([DABEST-Matlab](https://github.com/ACCLAB/DABEST-Matlab)).
