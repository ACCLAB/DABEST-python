## Requirements

Python 3.8 is strongly recommended. DABEST has also been tested with
Python 3.6 and 3.7.

In addition, the following packages are also required (listed with their
minimal versions):

- [numpy 1.19](https://www.numpy.org)
- [scipy 1.5](https://www.scipy.org)
- [matplotlib 3.3](https://www.matplotlib.org)
- [pandas 1.1](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [seaborn 0.11](https://seaborn.pydata.org)
- [lqrt 0.3](https://github.com/alyakin314/lqrt)

To obtain these package dependencies easily, it is highly recommended to
download the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution
of Python.

## Installation

1.  Using `pip`

At the command line, run

**\$ pip install dabest**

2.  Using Github

Clone the [DABEST-python repo](https://github.com/ACCLAB/DABEST-python)
locally (see instructions \[here\]
(https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).

Then, navigate to the cloned repo in the command line and run

**\$ pip install**

## Testing

To test DABEST, you will need to install
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

Run `pytest` in the root directory of the source distribution. This runs
the test suite in `dabest/tests` folder. The test suite will ensure that
the bootstrapping functions and the plotting functions perform as
expected.
