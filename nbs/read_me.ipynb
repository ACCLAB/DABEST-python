    "## Recent Version Update\n",
    "\n",
    "We are proud to announce **DABEST Version Dadar (v2025.03.14)** This new version of the DABEST Python library provides several new features and performance improvements. It's a big one!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python 3.13 Support**: DABEST now supports Python 3.10-3.13.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Horizontal Plots**: This new feature allows users to create horizontal plots instead of the regular vertical plots, providing a more compact visualization of data. This can be utilized by setting `horizontal=True` in the `plot()` method. See the [Horizontal Plots](../tutorials/08-horizontal_plot.html) tutorial for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Forest Plots**: This new feature allows users to create forest plots! Forest plots provide a simple and intuitive way to visualize many delta-delta (or Deltas' g) or mini-meta effect sizes at once from multiple different dabest objects without presenting the raw data. See the [Forest Plots](../tutorials/07-forest_plot.html) tutorial for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gridkey**: This new feature allows users to create a gridkey to represent the labels of the groups in the plot. This can be utilized with the `gridkey_rows` argument in the `plot()` method. See the gridkey section in the [Plot Aesthetics](../tutorials/09-plot_aesthetics.html) tutorial for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Aesthetic Updates**: We have made several aesthetic improvements to the plots, including:\n",
    "   - **Swarm, Contrast, and Summary bars**: We have added bars to better highlight the various groups and their differences. These bars can be customized to suit the user's needs. The swarm and contrast bars are provided by default, while the summary bars can be added by the user. See the relevant sections in the [Plot Aesthetics](../tutorials/09-plot_aesthetics.html) tutorial for more details.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - **Delta-Delta Plots**: We have modified the delta-delta plot format to be more compact and easier to read. The new format brings the delta-delta (or Deltas' g) effect size closer to the regular effect sizes. In addition, a gap has been added to the zeroline to separate the delta-delta and regular effect sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Delta-delta Effect Sizes for Proportion Plots**: Delta-delta effect sizes for proportion plots are now available.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - **Mini-Meta Plots**: We have modified the mini-meta plot format to be more compact and easier to read. The new format brings the mini-meta effect size closer to the regular effect sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Proportion Plots Sample Sizes**: We have updated the proportion plots to show sample sizes for each group. These can be toggled on or off via the `prop_sample_counts` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Effect Size Lines for Paired Plots**: Effect size lines for paired plots are now available. These can be toggled on or off via the `es_paired_lines` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Baseline Error Curves**: Plots now include a baseline error dot and curve to show the error of the baseline/control group. By default, the dot is shown, while the curve can be added by the user (via the `show_baseline_ec` parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Delta Text**: There is now an option to display delta text on the contrast axes. It displays the effect size of the contrast group relative to the reference group. This can be toggled on or off via the `delta_text` parameter. It is on by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Empty Circle Color Palette**: A new swarmplot color palette modification is available for unpaired plots via the `empty_circle` parameter in the `plot()` method. This option modifies the two-group swarmplots to have empty circles for the control group and filled circles for the experimental group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Miscellaneous Improvements & Adjustments**\n",
    "    - **Numba for Speed Improvements**: We have included Numba to speed up the various calculations in DABEST. This should make the calculations faster and more efficient. Importing DABEST may take a little longer than before, and a progress bar will appear during the import process to show the calculations being performed. Once imported, loading and plotting data should now be faster.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    - **Terminology Updates**: We have made several updates to the documentation and terminology to improve clarity and consistency. For example:\n",
    "  \n",
    "      - The method to utilise the Deltas' g effect size is now via the `.hedges_g.plot()` method now rather than creating a whole new `Delta_g` object as before. The functionality remains the same, it plots hedges_g effect sizes and then the Deltas' g effect size alongside these (if a delta-delta experiment was loaded correctly).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Updated Tutorial Pages**: We have updated the tutorial pages to reflect the new features and changes. The tutorial pages are now more comprehensive and hopefully more intuitive!\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Results Dataframe for Delta-Delta and Mini-Meta Plots**: A results dataframe can now be extracted for both the delta-delta and mini-meta effect size data (similar to the results dataframe for the regular effect sizes). These can be found via the `.results` attribute of the `.delta_delta` or `.mini_meta` object.\n",

    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "DABEST is a package for **D**ata **A**nalysis using **B**ootstrap-Coupled **EST**imation.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Estimation statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_statistics) are a [simple framework](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/) that avoids the [pitfalls](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3288) of significance testing. It employs familiar statistical concepts such as means, mean differences, and error bars. More importantly, it focuses on the effect size of one's experiment or intervention, rather than succumbing to a false dichotomy engendered by *P* values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimation plot comprises two key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It presents all data points as a swarm plot, ordering each point to display the underlying distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It illustrates the effect size as a **bootstrap 95% confidence interval** on a **separate but aligned axis**.\n",
