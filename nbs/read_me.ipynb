    "## Recent Version Update\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear Dabest users\n",
    "âœ¨**DABEST Bingka v2025.10.20** for Python is now released! âœ¨\n",
    "\n",
    "This new version of the DABEST Python library includes new features, updated graphics, and improved calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Whorlmap ðŸŒ€**: Introducing a new way to visualize effect sizes from multiple comparisons in a grid of whorled square cells. This design condenses information from full bootstrap distributions of an array of contrast objects into a compact visual representation. It optimizes visual real estate by presenting a clear impression of the whole dataset at a glance while retaining nuanced distributional information for further scrutiny. Whorlmaps are a space-efficient alternative to stacked forest plots when working with multi-dimensional DABEST objects from large scale experiments. \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Slopegraphs have a new look ðŸ“ˆ**: Slopegraphs for paired continuous data now show summary statistics for each group. By default, a thick trend line connects group means, with vertical bars indicating standard deviation. Users can choose the summary type via the `group_summaries` argument in .plot() â€” options include `'mean_sd'`, `'median_quartiles'`, or `None`. Appearance can be customized using `group_summaries_kwargs`. See the group summaries section in the Plot Aesthetics tutorial for more details.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Fixed Mini-meta Weighted Delta Calculation ðŸ§®**: The weighted delta in mini-meta plots has been updated to ensure accurate calculation and reporting of the weighted delta.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Expanded custom_palette functionality ðŸŽ¨**:\n",
    "     - **Barplots (unpaired, proportional)**: The custom_palette dict can now take 0 and 1 as keys to color the filled and unfilled portions of the plots. See the custom palette section in the Plot Aesthetics tutorial for more details.\n",
    "  \n",
    "     - **Slopegraphs (paired, non proportional)**: The custom_palette can now be used to color the contrast bars and effect-size curves. See the custom palette section in the Plot Aesthetics tutorial for more details."

    "\n",
    "DABEST is a package for **D**ata **A**nalysis using **B**ootstrap-Coupled **EST**imation.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Estimation statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_statistics) are a [simple framework](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/) that avoids the [pitfalls](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3288) of significance testing. It employs familiar statistical concepts such as means, mean differences, and error bars. More importantly, it focuses on the effect size of one's experiment or intervention, rather than succumbing to a false dichotomy engendered by *P* values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimation plot comprises two key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It presents all data points as a swarm plot, ordering each point to display the underlying distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It illustrates the effect size as a **bootstrap 95% confidence interval** on a **separate but aligned axis**.\n",

    "![The five kinds of estimation plots](showpiece.png \"The five kinds of estimation plots.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "DABEST powers [estimationstats.com](https://www.estimationstats.com/), allowing everyone access to high-quality estimation plots.\n"
