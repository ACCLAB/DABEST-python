    "## Recent Version Update\n",
    "\n",
    "We are proud to announce **DABEST Version Ondeh (v2024.03.29)**. This new version of the DABEST Python library provides several new features and includes performance improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **New Paired Proportion Plot**: This feature builds upon the existing proportional analysis capabilities by introducing advanced aesthetics and clearer visualization of changes in proportions between different groups, inspired by the informative nature of Sankey Diagrams. It's particularly useful for studies that require detailed examination of how proportions shift in paired observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customizable Swarm Plot**: Enhancements allow for tailored swarm plot aesthetics, notably the adjustment of swarm sides to produce asymmetric swarm plots. This customization enhances data representation, making visual distinctions more pronounced and interpretations clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standardized Delta-delta Effect Size**: We added a new metric akin to a Hedges’ g for delta-delta effect size, which allows comparisons between delta-delta effects generated from metrics with different units. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Miscellaneous Improvements**: This version also encompasses a broad range of miscellaneous enhancements, including bug fixes, Bootstrapping speed improvements, new templates for raising issues, and updated unit tests. These improvements are designed to streamline the user experience, increase the software's stability, and expand its versatility. By addressing user feedback and identified issues, DABEST continues to refine its functionality and reliability.\n"

    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "DABEST is a package for **D**ata **A**nalysis using **B**ootstrap-Coupled **EST**imation.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Estimation statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_statistics) are a [simple framework](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/) that avoids the [pitfalls](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3288) of significance testing. It employs familiar statistical concepts such as means, mean differences, and error bars. More importantly, it focuses on the effect size of one's experiment or intervention, rather than succumbing to a false dichotomy engendered by *P* values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimation plot comprises two key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It presents all data points as a swarm plot, ordering each point to display the underlying distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It illustrates the effect size as a **bootstrap 95% confidence interval** on a **separate but aligned axis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The five kinds of estimation plots](showpiece.png \"The five kinds of estimation plots.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "DABEST powers [estimationstats.com](https://www.estimationstats.com/), allowing everyone access to high-quality estimation plots.\n"
